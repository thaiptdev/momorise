In that one second, she suddenly realised how close her mother was to her, not as far away as she thought before. As the day is about to end, something new grows gradually: a bond between mother and daughter.\n\nPainted in the daughter’s point of view, this painting shows the mother smiling happily, reaching her hand as if she wanted to invite us to view the sunset with her, suggesting a willingness to communicate and understand from the mother.",
